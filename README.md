# My Portfolio â€“ Jacob WahlstrÃ¶m

Hi there!

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and hosted via GitHub Pages.

I use this site to showcase my projects, share a bit about myself, and make it easy to get in touch.

Thanks for stopping by!
